# Security-Tutorials
A few basic computer security tutorials for everyday humans.
In the Wiki of this repository, I cover a few very basic security topics that slightly or moderately tech savvy individuals may need to know about to avoid shooting themselves in the foot.
I plan to add to this repo over time to cover more common security concerns in a way that non-geeks can understand.
Cybersecurity isn't a geek's game anymore. In our increasingly connected world, it's increasingly relevant for everyone.
